# Lockdown Lunacy

A Lockdown Lunacy event consists of a number of Rooms. At any point in time each room has a DJ streaming a live performance, a Default Space and potentially many other Spaces. A Space is a video conference where participants may dance together online. A Space is maintained by a Host.

For any event Lockdown Lunacy will maintain a list of Hosted Rooms. Pre-event we offer technology testing services for Room Hosts and DJs. Below is a set of links to support events
